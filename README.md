# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The goal of this project was to compare the effectiveness of machine learning models on identifying credit risk. This dataset was unbalanced as there are far more good loans than risky loans. Thus, the approach taken here focused on training and evaluating models with unbalanced classes. More specifically, I compared oversampling models such as RandomOverSampler and SMOTE, as well as undersampling models such as ClusterCentroids. In addition, I also used the under-over sampling model SMOTEEN. Finally, I also used BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, which are algorithims that focus on reducing bias.
